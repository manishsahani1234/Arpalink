1. Code Quality
Consistency: Ensure that the code follows consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for classes).
Readability: Check for proper indentation, spacing, and comments that enhance code readability.
Modularity: Verify that the code is modular, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., DAO, service, and model layers).

2. Functionality Testing
User Registration: Test the user registration functionality to ensure that users can register successfully and that their data is stored correctly.
Profile Display: Verify that the user profile displays the correct information after registration.
Input Validation: Check that all user inputs are validated (e.g., required fields, email format) and that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.

3. Exception Handling
Ensure that the application handles exceptions gracefully. For example, if a database operation fails, the application should not crash but should provide a user-friendly error message.

4. Dependency Management
Review the pom.xml file to ensure that all necessary dependencies are included and that there are no unnecessary dependencies.
Check for any updates to dependencies and ensure that the project is using compatible versions.

5. Unit Tests
Ensure that unit tests are written for all critical components (e.g., DAO and service classes).
Run the unit tests to verify that they pass successfully and cover various scenarios, including edge cases.

6. Documentation
Check that all classes and methods are documented with Javadoc comments.
Ensure that the README file (if applicable) provides clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.
